** *Our MVP (Minimum Viable Product) version of our Python WOW looks like this:* **

In our MVP, users will be able to search for doctors by inputting thier zip code or a specific symptom or ailment. The output would provide the user with a list of doctors by specialty, and location according to their input. Our Python Doctors' site will specialize in offering the user the access to an array of doctors of multiple ethnicities who embrace caring for a diverse community. We aim to make this app user friendly by providing useful resources for all.
 
### Instructions on how to run the app: 

#### on a PC or Mac:

cd into flask

git pull

set FLASK_APP=app.py

python -m flask run

copy the url

paste url in your browser

viola!

#### Suggestions on what to search for: 

Speciality - Anesthesiology, Family Medicine, Pathology, Surgery

Zip Code - 95032, 93960, 92078, 96001 


### We used the following packages/libraries:

#### from flask import Flask, redirect, url_for, render_template, request, session, flash
We used flask to build a web application, flask helped us to generate the doctor database

#### datetime import timedelta
We used timedelta to perform date manipulations

#### import pandas as pd
We used pandas for data analysis of our doctor database

#### import csv
We used import csv to generate our database

##### Devika worked on: 

The README.mdfile, found a Doctor Database, cleaned up the database with teammates, commented on the code, added gitignore with Lillie, filtered for the speciality, and unit testing with Lillie, Gary, Paul and Eva

##### Eva worked on: 

Added to the README.mdfile, cleaned up the database, commented the code, backend duties by taking on the tasks of filtering our Doctor Database using Python, Jupyter Notebook, and lastly Flask to make the flow of data from front to back as smooth as possible with unit testing

##### Gary worked on:

Added to the README.md file, code linguist, cleaned up the database, frontend and backend duties contributed his past knowledge of CSS, HTML, and JavaScript as well as some newly developed skills to create our user-friendly Python Doctors frontend webpages. Gary also made it a point to learn Flask, which would ultimately be instrumental in the connection coding of the frontend to the backend database unit testing,
