** *Our MVP (Minimum Viable Product) version of our Python WOW looks like this:* **

In our MVP, users will be able to search for doctors by inputting thier zip code or a specific symptom or ailment. The output would provide the user with a list of doctors by specialty, and location according to their input. Our Python Doctors' site will specialize in offering the user the access to an array of doctors of multiple ethnicities who embrace caring for a diverse community. We aim to make this app user friendly by providing useful resources for all.
 


### We used the following packages/libraries:

#### from flask import Flask, redirect, url_for, render_template, request, session, flash
We used flask to build a web application

#### datetime import timedelta
We used timedelta to perform date manipulations

#### import pandas as pd
We used pandas for data analysis of our doctor database

#### import csv
We used import csv generate our database
